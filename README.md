<!-- # barebones

barebones is a static project starter built from the ground up. My goal is to only include the packages and functionality I need, when I need it.

## Node Dependencies

* [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) - [Tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-use-browsersync-for-faster-development)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)

## JS Libraries

* [d3 v5.5.0](https://d3js.org/)
* [jQuery v3.3.1](https://jquery.com/)
* [p5 v0.6.1](https://p5js.org/)
* [p5.dom.js v0.3.4](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.dom)

You may or may not need these libraries. The default includes only d3 min - code for the others is included but commented out. I also may update this starter to include the node version of these libraries (if available), instead of including them in the <head> tag of our index.html page (the old-school style).

## How-To

To start a new project by cloning this repository:

```
git clone 'https://github.com/ryanabest/barebones'
```

Once you rename the 'barebones' folder to your project name, cd to that folder then run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This final command will open a server in your browser that hosts your project (available at localhost:3000). Your browser will now watch for any changes you make and automatically incorporate these changes once they are saved.

## Next Additions
